Using Chat GPT within the search_users.py file, I was able to learn how to sort a dictionary on the basis of the length of the dictionary value string.

Prompt: how to sort dictionary by length of value string in python.

Result: You can sort a Python dictionary by the length of its values' strings using the sorted() function with a custom sorting key. Here's an example:

    # Sample dictionary
    my_dict = {
        'apple': 'red',
        'banana': 'yellow',
        'cherry': 'red',
        'date': 'brown',
        'elderberry': 'purple',
    }

    # Sort the dictionary by length of values' strings
    sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: len(item[1])))

    # Print the sorted dictionary
    print(sorted_dict)

In this example, the sorted() function is used with a lambda function as the sorting key. The lambda function takes an item (key-value pair) from the dictionary and sorts based on the length of the value (item[1]). The resulting dictionary, sorted_dict, will be sorted by the length of the values' strings. Note that the original dictionary remains unchanged, and a new sorted dictionary is created.

My code: dict(sorted(res1.items(), key=lambda item: len(item[1]))) where res1 is a dictionary containing the search result user ids as the keys and the names as the values.
